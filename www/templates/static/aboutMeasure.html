				<span translate>M-Lab offers a number of measurement tools, allowing consumers to test for everything from network speed and latency to blocking and throttling. All tools perform only active measurements against the M-Lab platform. This means that M-Lab tests measure how your network connection responds to a synthetic stream of data generated by the individual tool solely for the purpose of measurement. The tools do not collect information about your other Internet traffic, such as emails, web searches, content you view, or any personally identifiable information. All data collected is made publicly available, including the IP address provided by your ISP at the edge of your network. All tools are open source and created by researchers.
